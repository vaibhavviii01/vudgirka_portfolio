# Portfolio
This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU!  Here's where all my cool work will go.  You should probably hire me. 

# **About me**
Hi! I am Vaibhavi! 
Iâ€™m a graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University, pursuing my Masterâ€™s in Information Systems Management, with a keen interest in Product Management and Data Analytics. My background in Electronics and Communication Engineering has shaped my analytical thinking and problem-solving skills, allowing me to explore how data-driven decision-making can drive impactful solutions.

In my journey so far, Iâ€™ve explored Machine Learning, Business Intelligence, and Product Design, gaining hands-on experience with Python, SQL, Tableau, and Power BI. My projects have ranged from analyzing consumer behavior in the eyewear industry to proposing AI-powered tools for early detection of Alzheimerâ€™s disease. Each experience has reinforced my belief in the power of data to drive meaningful change.

When Iâ€™m not diving into datasets or fine-tuning models, youâ€™ll find me exploring new tech trends, brainstorming product ideas, or indulging in my love for writing and sitcom shows. Iâ€™m always eager to learn, collaborate, and build something impactful, letâ€™s connect!ðŸš€

# **What I hope to learn-**
As I begin this course, I aim to strengthen both my technical and storytelling skills in Data Visualization. Here are few of the key areas I hope to learn and grow in: 

## - Building a Professional Portfolio: 
I want to learn how to create a polished, easy-to-share portfolio that not only highlights my Data Visualization projects but also reflects my skills, creativity, and growth.

## - Improving Data Visualization Designs
I want to learn how to create concise, visually appealing, and successful data visualizations by following best practices for color, layout, text, and chart selection.

## - Think Like a Designer
I want to learn how to approach data visualization with a designer's attitude, emphasizing clarity, simplicity, and aesthetics, in order to make complex information understandable and interesting for any audience.

## - Telling Stories with Data
I want to learn how to create meaningful, compelling data stories that connect with people, highlight insights, and drive action, rather than just delivering numbers.

## - Emphasizing What Matters
I want to understand how to emphasize the most significant facts in a visualization while subtly graying out or decreasing less important features, allowing viewers to focus on crucial insights at a glance.
