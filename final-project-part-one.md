# Outline

This analysis and visualisation uses a dataset of almost 1,000 samples that combines fitness measures, activity characteristics, and demographic information to investigate exercise and health trends among gym patrons. Finding important information about exercise habits, performance-influencing variables, and behaviors that may be signs of health problems is the aim.

The analysis aims to address the following important questions: 

- Do workout outcomes, such as heart rate or calories burned, differ between men and women?
- Which forms of exercise are best for cardiovascular demand and calorie efficiency?
- Is it possible to divide members of the gym into different groups depending on how they work out?
- This analysis also identifies people who might be at risk for health problems because of a combination of high BMI, seldom exercise, and excessive resting heart rate.

The goal of this analysis is to develop a story about fitness efficiency, diversity in exercise routines, and useful health insights by integrating descriptive analysis, clustering, and performance benchmarks. The story is intended to be both engaging and evidence-based, providing researchers, coaches, and fitness lovers with data-driven insights.


## Initial sketches

As fitness becomes more and more data-driven, examining the connections between demographics, exercise preferences, and physiological results can provide information that helps researchers, trainers, and individuals. I found that the dataset of 973 users of gyms offers a special chance to explore the relationships between fitness, exercise, and health. Along with physiological and demographic information like age, gender, BMI, and body fat percentage, it also includes metrics related to workout performance like heart rate, number of calories burned, and length of session. This combination will enable me to examine both physiological and behavioral patterns, contributing to the resolution of more general inquiries about effectiveness, well-being, and fitness advancement.

# Examining Disparities by Gender

First, the analysis looks at whether gender makes a difference in workout performance, an issue that is frequently brought up in fitness and health research. The visualisation aims to determine whether there are significant differences in workout intensity or results between male and female gym customers by comparing their average heart rates, session duartion, and calories burned. I want to provide evidence-based insights into how gender may affect exercise behaviors and physiological responses.

# Comparisons of Workout Types

The project then examines workout styles, determining which sorts of exercise are best for increasing cardiovascular demand and burning calories. The analysis will show which routines burn the most calories each session and which maintain higher average and maximum heart rates by classifying members according to workout categories like cardio, strength training, yoga, and HIIT. The purpose of these comparisons is to demonstrate the manner in which various training approaches affect cardiovascular health and energy expenditure, offering insightful conclusions for those looking to customize their workouts to meet certain objectives.

# Grouping Participants into Clusters

The visualisation uses clustering techniques to divide gym members into discrete groups according to workout habits, going beyond descriptive comparisons. Clustering will assist in identifying organic patterns that classify individuals into profiles such as "endurance-focused," "high-intensity," or "casual trainers" based on attributes like session length, workout frequency, and calories burned. Through this, I want to demonstrate that, a more comprehensive understanding of exercise routines is offered by the segmentation, which portrays that fitness practices differ greatly among people rather than being consistent. The clusters provide a simple method of comprehending the variety of methods people use to approach their exercise regimens.

# Health Indicators & Hazard Assessment

By using standards pertaining to BMI, resting heart rate, and workout frequency, the research also looks into possible health hazards among gym patrons. As an example of how data can be utilized to uncover warning indicators, members with high BMI numbers, elevated resting heart rates, and infrequent workouts are identified as potentially at danger. I want to emphasize how crucial it is to track several health indicators concurrently rather than separately in order to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of general fitness and wellbeing.

## The data

The Gym Members Exercise Dataset [Kaggle â€“ Gym Members Exercise Dataset], offers comprehensive records of fitness and health characteristics for gym members, serves as the main dataset for this project. Along with workout-specific variables like session duration, calories burnt, heart rate (resting, average, maximum), body fat percentage, water intake, workout frequency, and experience level, it includes demographic data like age, gender, height, and weight. This dataset provides a solid basis for researching exercise habits, examining health metrics, and determining workout effectiveness. It strikes a mix between breadth and depth with almost 1,000 examples, allowing for both descriptive and predictive analysis across a variety of fitness characteristics.

I will utilize the dataset to investigate a number of important topics for this project, including whether workout outcomes for men and women differ, what kinds of workouts are best for heart rate intensity and calorie burn, and how gym patrons might be categorized into useful groups based on workout habits. In order to identify people who may be at risk, I will also look at health metrics like BMI and resting heart rate. I will also compute workout efficiency (calories burned per hour) and provide helpful advice. Through these visualisations, I will be able to relate exercise results to demographic characteristics and offer practical advice for enhancing fitness regimens.

# Method and medium

For my final project, I want to use Tableau to make interactive data visualizations and Shorthand as the main platform for presenting the story of my analysis. Visual components including clustering plots, workout efficiency and comparative charts for gender disparities will be created using Tableau and included into my Shorthand narrative. By using this method, I can create a seamless, interactive experience for the audience by fusing the storytelling capabilities of Shorthand with the analytical capabilities of Tableau.

From providing background information and introducing the dataset to examining gender disparities, workout comparisons, segmentation, health hazards, and the best workout insights, the Shorthand presentation will walk viewers through every step of the project. I'll make sure the audience can engage with the data and follow the tale by integrating Tableau graphics right into the Shorthand narrative. This strategy will produce a final product that can be accessed as a digital, stand-alone project and is both aesthetically pleasing and data-driven.
