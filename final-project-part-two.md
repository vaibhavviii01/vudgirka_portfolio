# From Calories to Clarity: How Exercise Fuels Mental Health

# Wireframes / storyboards
When I first began this project, my focus was narrow: I wanted to see how different workouts compared in terms of physical performance. But from the professor's feedback and the critique exercise in the class, it became clear that the story could be so much bigger. Being fit has more to do with health risks, mental wellness, and even happiness than it does with calories and heart rate. I broadened my dataset to incorporate a wider range of fitness and lifestyle parameters in order to address this. This allowed me to tell a broader story of how exercise impacts not only the body, but also the mind and overall quality of life.

This story's trajectory reflects the path of health itself: we start with the benefits of exercise, then discuss how it relates to risk and performance, and then conclude with how it affects happiness and mental health. I was able to produce a narrative that is more comprehensive, perceptive, and ultimately more relatable by enlarging my dataset and incorporating feedback.

However, this endeavor is about more than just fitness; it's about comprehending how exercise affects our mental health. Calorie tracking and step counting only provide just a part of the picture. The deeper value of exercise is in how it helps us sleep better, manage stress, reduce anxiety, and feel more resilient in daily life. When we look at the data this way, a workout session is not just burning calories, it’s building mental strength.
I will use this storyboard as the basis for my Part III draft in Shorthand, where I will polish the narrative and improve the flow.

## The Introduction: Understanding Workouts.

The story begins with a basic yet important question: What benefits can different workouts provide?

In my Workout Effectiveness by Type visualization, I display calories burned and average BPM for cardio, HIIT, strength, and yoga. The takeaway is evident: each workout has a distinct function. HIIT increases intensity, Cardio and Strength improve calorie efficiency, while Yoga gives restorative benefits at a reduced intensity. This lays the groundwork – exercise is not one-size-fits-all, and people choose activities for a variety of reasons.

From here, I zoom in on individual differences. My Gender-Based Workout Performance chart analyzes calories, BPM, and session duration for both male and female participants. The interesting lesson is that, whereas males burn more calories, their effort levels (heart rate and duration) are nearly identical. This shows that the difference is driven by physiology rather than motivation, highlighting the need of carefully interpreting fitness data.

## The Middle: Identifying Risk and Segmentation

The next section of the story moves from performance to health. Using Clustering Fitness Profiles, I divide gym members into natural groups. Some are casual exercisers who engage in short, light workouts. Others are steady and moderate burners. Then there's a set of top performers who push both length and calorie burn to their limits. These clusters serve as a reminder that fitness experiences vary greatly, and that no single message or regimen will appeal to everyone.

However, exercise is more than just a choice; it is also about risk. In the Health Risk Patterns (BMI vs Resting BPM) scatterplot, I use cutoff lines at BMI 30 and BPM 90 to distinguish between individuals in the safe and worrisome zones. The majority of participants fall into the healthy quadrant, however a subset with a high BMI and higher resting BPM stands out. This  group may require not just encouragement to exercise more, but also medical supervision and closer monitoring.  My dataset doesn't include any "At Risk" people (Fortunately! good for them!). The picture below represents the story's transition from physical performance to potential health repercussions.

## The End: The Mind-Lifestyle Connection

The final act of the story expands on mental health and lifestyle outcomes. The "Mental Health Condition Distribution by Exercise Level" visualization presents a compelling picture: people who exercise more have much fewer incidences of anxiety and depression, whereas those who exercise less have greater rates of these diseases. The data reinforces what many suspect but now see clearly, physical activity protects mental health!

Finally, I conclude with happiness because, at the end of the day, health is more than just preventing illness; it is also about living well.  The Diet × Exercise × Happiness chart shows how different diets and activity levels influence happiness. Balanced meals mixed with high levels of activity promote sustained well-being, although there are some exceptions, such as junk food combined with moderate exercise resulting in a temporary increase in happiness. This presents an intriguing question, which I'd like to investigate further: why does this paradoxical pattern appear, and what psychological or physiological elements could explain it? It serves as a reminder that health is multifaceted, and that short-term happiness does not always equate to long-term well-being.

# User research 

To improve my storyboard and ensure that my visuals are clear and engaging, I carried out user research with three people who represent the demographic I want to attract. The purpose was to assess the clarity, flow, and impact of my draft wireframes, as well as to highlight areas where design improvements could improve the story's effectiveness.

## Target audience

The major target audience for this narrative is young adults and working professionals who are health-conscious but not data experts. They are people who monitor their fitness levels (via wearables or gym records), are interested in exercise and wellness, and want to understand how their lifestyle choices affect their mental and physical health.

**Approach to Identifying Participants**

I chose three people from my network to represent this audience.

**Participant A** : A college student who exercises on occasion and is interested in balancing fitness and stress management.

**Participant B** : A young professional who regularly goes to the gym and uses a smartwatch to track health indicators.

**Participant C** :  An amateur athlete who exercises at a high intensity and is interested in how mental health data relates to workouts.

Each participant was presented a draft storyboard and Tableau visualizations. I asked them to lead me through the story and offer their thoughts.

## Interview script

The following questions guided the interviews:


| Goal                                | Questions to Ask                                                                 |
|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Assess the story flow               | What was your initial opinion of this story flow?                                |
| Evaluate clarity of visuals         | Were the visualizations easy to understand? Which ones were the easiest to grasp?|
| Identify unclear/confusing elements | Did any charts confuse or overwhelm you?                                         |
| Explore engagement and surprises    | What elements of the story did you find most intriguing or surprising?            |

| Check framing preference            | Did the story focus more on "fitness data" or "well-being"? How should it be framed? |



## Interview findings 


| Questions                         | Interview 1 (Student)                                                                                       | Interview 2 (Professional)                                                                 | Interview 3 (Athlete)                                                                 |
|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Initial impression of the story   | Found Gender Comparison chart very relatable: *“I could see myself in this, it felt personal.”*              | Engaged with BMI vs Resting BPM scatterplot: *“The cutoffs make it instantly clear who’s at risk.”* | Found Workout Type Effectiveness chart most useful for reflecting on training choices.  |
| Clarity of visualizations         | Struggled with Clustering chart — hard to follow without descriptive labels.                                | Felt story leaned too much toward fitness data, needed stronger focus on mental health.    | Enjoyed Diet × Exercise × Happiness chart, found it “surprising and fun.”               |
| Suggestions for improvement       | Suggested simpler legends and more annotations for clarity.                                                 | Suggested connecting visuals more explicitly to lifestyle and mental health impacts.       | Suggested highlighting unexpected insights more directly (e.g., junk food + exercise). |



# Identified changes for Part III


| Research synthesis                                                                                  | Anticipated changes for Part III                                                                 |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Clustering chart was confusing and hard to interpret without labels.                                | Rename clusters with descriptive labels (e.g., “Casual Exercisers,” “Efficient Burners,” “High Performers”). |
| BMI scatterplot and Diet × Happiness chart lacked clarity in interpretation.                        | Add annotations to highlight significance of quadrants and spikes.                              |
| Narrative felt too focused on fitness numbers rather than well-being.                               | Reframing introductions to emphasize mental health and lifestyle impacts alongside fitness.        |
| Legends and colors in the mental health stacked bar chart were difficult to parse.                   | Simplify legends and adjust color schemes to improve readability.                               |
| Readers may miss key insights unless explicitly pointed out.                                        | Use callouts, subtitles, and annotations to highlight important lessons directly.                |
| Gender Comparison and Diet × Exercise × Happiness charts were engaging and clear.                   | Keep these visualizations as they are, but use them as models for clarity in other charts.       |



The feedback highlighted where my visualizations already communicate effectively (Gender disparity chart, workout effectiveness chart)  and where they want improvement (Clustering, Scatterplot). Importantly, participants felt that the story should focus on how these decisions relate to mental health, stress, and happiness more rather than calories and workouts in and of themselves.


This is consistent with the professor's remarks and will guide the next revision of my project. In Part III, I will improve my visualizations and write a shorthand story to emphasize exercise as a tool for not only physical fitness, but also for living healthier, happier lives.


# Moodboards / personas


To ground the story in real-world perspectives, I created three personas that represent different segments of my target audience: Taylor, a college student balancing academics with light exercise for stress relief; Shanky, a young professional and software engineer at Amazon who uses his smartwatch and regular workouts to track both fitness and performance; and William, a novice athlete who trains at high intensity and is especially curious about the connection between These personas not only reflect the variety of exercise routines and objectives, but also demonstrate how fitness is seen differently across lifestyles, making the statistics more relatable and human-centered.
